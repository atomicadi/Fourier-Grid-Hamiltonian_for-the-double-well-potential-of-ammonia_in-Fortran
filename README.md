# 1D Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) for the double well potential of ammonia in Fortran
Due to the rapid transformation of ammonia's equilibrium geometry (C<sub>3V</sub>) to its' mirror-image strucrure (which in invarient and same C<sub>3V</sub> point group) via ammonia's umbrella inversion mode, ammonia is trapped inside a symmetric double well potential. This rapid transformation is occured through a planner sp<sup>2</sup> hybridiged geometry (D<sub>3h</sub>) which is responsiple for the potential barrier in this doble well potential. The form of the potential is,
<p align="center">


$$
V(x) = \frac{V_{max}}{b^4} ((x- \frac{a}{2})^2 - b^2)^2  ...... (1)
$$


</p>

Where V<sub>max</sub> = Potential at the central maxima, (/frac{a}{2} Â± b) = Location of the two local minima, \frac{a}{2} = Location of the central maxima
