# 1D Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) for the double well potential of NH<sub>3</sub> in Fortran and Morse potential of H<sub>2</sub>

Due to the rapid transformation of ammonia's equilibrium geometry (C<sub>3V</sub>) to its' mirror-image strucrure (which in invarient and same C<sub>3V</sub> point group) via ammonia's umbrella inversion mode, ammonia is trapped inside a symmetric double well potential (denoted as DWP in the rest of the README). This rapid transformation is occured through a planner sp<sup>2</sup> hybridiged geometry (D<sub>3h</sub>) which is responsiple for the potential barrier in this DWP. The form of the potential is,
<p align="center">


$$
V(x) = \frac{V_{max}}{b^4} ((x- \frac{a}{2})^2 - b^2)^2  ...... (1)
$$


</p>

Where V<sub>max</sub> = Potential at the central maxima, ($\frac{a}{2}$ Â± b) = Location of the two local minima, $\frac{a}{2}$ = Location of the central maxima.

The potential barrier in this DWP satisfies the conditions necessary for quantum tunneling, leading to transmission through the barrier. This, in turn, causes the splitting of the localized energy levels within each well of the DWP.
