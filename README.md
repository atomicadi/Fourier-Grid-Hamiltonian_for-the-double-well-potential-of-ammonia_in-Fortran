# 1D Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) for the double well potential of ammonia in Fortran
Due to the rapid transformation of ammonia's equilibrium geometry (C<sub>3V</sub>) to its' mirror-image strucrure (which in invarient and same C<sub>3V</sub> point group) via ammonia's umbrella inversion mode, ammonia is trapped inside a symmetric double well potential. This rapid transformation is occured through a planner sp<sup>2</sup> hybridiged geometry (D<sub>3h</sub>) which is responsiple for the potential barrier in this doble well potential.
